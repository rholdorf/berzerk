## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: MonoGame 3.8.4.1 + .NET 8 chosen as foundation (cross-platform support)
- Phase 1: Mixamo assets for 3D models/animations (quality free assets)
- Phase 1: FBX 2013 format required (MonoGame content pipeline compatibility)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- Phase 1: FBX animation import is highest technical risk - custom content processor required
- Phase 1: Cross-platform content pipeline must be validated on all targets early
- Future: Third-person camera clipping requires collision detection from start (Phase 2)
- Future: AI pathfinding must be async to avoid performance collapse (Phase 5)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-01-31 (roadmap creation)
Stopped at: ROADMAP.md and STATE.md created, ready for phase 1 planning
