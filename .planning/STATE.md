## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Strict 5-phase dependency chain (types -> processor -> runtime -> rendering -> integration) derived from architecture research
- [Roadmap]: GAME-01 and GAME-02 assigned to Phase 4 (rendering) rather than Phase 5 because they are prerequisites for visual verification

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: MonoGame Issue #3057 (SkinnedEffect silently ignored) requires workaround in Phase 2
- [Research]: FBX compatibility with Assimp 5.x is unverified -- test early in Phase 2, Blender re-export is fallback
